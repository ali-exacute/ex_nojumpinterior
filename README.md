# ex_nojumpinterior

**Please check out fivem forum post for video and pictures** : https://forum.cfx.re/t/standalone-esx-no-jump-in-interiors/2490536

This is a small script for all of you that want to disable player **jumping** or **running** in interiors (like in police department, medical center and ....)
i didn't see any script like this being released, so here we go!

>you can set a default option to disable either or both of them


>you can set any player character to be able to jump/run (or vice versa) in interiors

>if you are using [ESX](https://github.com/esx-framework/es_extended) (or [ExM](https://github.com/extendedmode/extendedmode)) , you can also make exceptions for any job (and also every single interior) if you want

>you can get the interior info (in your Fivem F8 console) by a configurable command in your config.lua

> installation : just download the script, drag it to your resources folder and add it to your server CFG, [config as you want] ,done!
